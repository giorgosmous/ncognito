# ncognito
ncongito is a little app I made for Mac that letâ€™s you obfuscate your MAC address and Hostname by randomising them on each boot.

It's written in Swift and some Applescript.

Now no network administrator can track how many times you have connected to his network or what computer you used because you are now incognito!

Your old-used MACs are not stored in any logs by ncognito so feel safe that you cannot be identified by any future scans of your Mac as on each boot you have a new identity!

ncongito uses a valid MAC Address wordlist that can be linked to a real device so that you cannot be characterised as an intruder by any suspicious eyed admin.
